<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<p>While on my Spring semester at Valencia College, I took two important classes for my major. Those classes are Graphic Design and Web Essentials. For my Graphics class, I did some projects using Adobe software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. For this portfolio, I am going to include a few of my works that I have done in that class, as well as some work from my Web Essentials class. So let's go!</p>
<h2>Graphics Works</h2>
<p>This is a building that we had to edit with Photoshop on our first assignment. Pretty basic Photoshop editing.</p>
<p>Before:</p>

<p>After:</p>

<br><img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="Logo" height="350" width="400">
<p>This is a logo for a fictional company that we had to make of using Illustrator. I went for a simple style design similar to the one used by Facebook.</p>
<img src="images/newsletter_page_1.jpg" alt="Newsletter pg.1" height="250" width="400">
<img src="images/newsletter_page_2.jpg" alt="Newsletter pg.2" height="250" width="400">
<p>This is a newsletter that I had to make of the fictional company using InDesign. InDesign was tough to work with, but in the end, it was worth it.</p>
<h2>Sites</h2>
<p>I made a file that has collection of all my sites that I have made this semester for my Web Essentials class. Click the link to download.</p>
