<h2>Francisco M. Diaz</h2>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>Now the story of myself. I was born and raised in the beautiful Caribbean island of Puerto Rico on September 29, 1998. I only spent half of my life growing up there, as my family later moved to Florida in 2005. In my early years I was like other kids, innocent and carefree, and also obsessed with toys. But I also found myself getting an interests on computers, as I would play games and look at random files on my parent's computer. It was at this time that I was also introduced to the incredible world of video games, as I received a Game Boy Advanced SP for Christmas when I was either 3 or 4. I wasn't really into game design or coding during this time, as I wasn't aware of it's existance. Fast forward now to 2013-2014, years after I moved to Florida, and I was in my first few years at University High School in Orlando. I had been playing video games for a long while now, but it was during this time that I would try out a game that forever changed my life. I was introduced to the hit open world sandbox survival game Minecraft. After I got my hands on it, I was completely amazed at how the game was designed. I soon realized that my true destiny in life is to make games.</p>

<h2>Working to Succeed</h2>
<p>During my my junior and senior years in high school, I realized that if I wanted to do game design in the future, I should start finding some way to learn some experience with coding. That's when I decided to take a web and digital design classes. This is where I started learning everything about HTML and CSS coding and how websites are made. In the beginning I mostly made websites using just Notepad, but then I was taught to use the more advanced Adobe Dreamweaver. The sites I made were mostly pre-rendered sites that needed to be fixed as shown in the instructions. I rarely ever made my own website design. After all of this, I eventually graduated from high school and was accepted to be a student at Valencia College East Campus, where I'm currently seeking a major in Graphics and Interactive design, but I might change this to either Fine Arts or Digital Media, since what I want to do is something related to creating video games. So far I have been enjoying my time at Valencia, and I have been having a great time in Professor Kern's Web Essentials class, and I'm happy that I got to know more about web design and how I got to use the more simpler and easier text editor, Brackets.</p>
